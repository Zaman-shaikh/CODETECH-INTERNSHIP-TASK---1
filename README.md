Features:

Create Tasks: Users add new tasks by entering a description and clicking "Add" or pressing Enter.
Manage Tasks: Added tasks appear as list items.
Complete Tasks: Clicking on a list item marks tasks as completed, visually differentiating them (e.g., strikethrough).
Remove Tasks: Users can remove unwanted tasks by clicking the "X" icon next to each list item.
Persistent Storage: The application utilizes localStorage to save the current task list, allowing users to revisit and maintain progress.
Technologies:

HTML: Defines the application's structure and content (buttons, input fields, lists).
CSS: Styles the application's visuals (layout, fonts, colors).
JavaScript: Adds interactivity by handling user actions and manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model).
Code Structure:

index.html: Defines the basic structure using HTML elements.
style.css: Contains CSS styles for visual appearance.
script.js: Contains JavaScript code for functionality (adding, marking completed, removing tasks, interacting with localStorage).
Images (if applicable): Custom images for buttons, icons, etc.

Conclusion:

This Todo List application demonstrates web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly platform for managing tasks and serves as a valuable learning experience for the CodeTech internship.
